This directory gives you all the necessary tools you need for the last week of glitch.

You should start by running setup_venv.sh to setup the virtual environment for the python webserver.
Afterwards you can run the web server by running the ./flask.sh. 

## Remote firefox debugging

To perform remote firefox debugging you need to tunnel the firefox debug interface over ssh. 

That is: 

DEBUG_PORT=13370 && ssh -L $DEBUG_PORT:127.0.0.1:$DEBUG_PORT das4
... reserve node
DEBUG_PORT=13370 && ssh -L $DEBUG_PORT:127.0.0.1:$DEBUG_PORT node00x

source bin/activate
./setup_ff.sh
./flask.sh


After you run setup_ff.sh the phone should be in shape to run your code. Then you can simply open the Firefox WebIDE (shift+F8) and connenct to the remote routine at localhost:$DEBUG_PORT


-L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
  Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host and
  port on the remote side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
  optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a connection is made to this port, the
  connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port hostport
  from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.  IPv6
  addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the superuser can
  forward privileged ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts
  setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific
  address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for local use
  only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available from all
  interfaces.
